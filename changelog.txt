- Edited "main.py" to properly display buttons depending if a user is logged in or not

Need to do:
- PEP8
- Comments (Only signed in users)
- Likes (One like from user per post)
- Edit (Only author)
- Delete Post (CRUD functionality, Only author)
- Fix "README.md"
- Only logged in users can Edit, Delete, Create, or like/Comment 
- Logged out users are redirected to the login page
